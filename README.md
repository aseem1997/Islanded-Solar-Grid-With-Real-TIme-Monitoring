# Islanded-Solar-Grid-With-Real-TIme-Monitoring

The proposal describes the design plan we have for the islanded solar grid with the real-time monitoring system which will be capable of providing constant needed power to the load. The project aims at harnessing solar power to run the load systems present in remote locations where power supply cannot be provided, along with acquiring and storing real-time for the analysis of supply and load system. The system will comprise of three units which will be Power supply unit, Control unit, and data acquisition unit. The project will be an innovation for the industries where the supply can get affected by the load, thus having an isolated supply system for the control circuitry systems will be very beneficial. The project is an achievable idea for the application of solar power harnessing on electrical systems.
